# Performance Measurements

For performance measurements, I relied on Xcode's Instrument panels, which provided all the necessary tools to evaluate the program's performance without needing any external software. In this folder, you will find several snapshots that capture key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and energy usage at various stages of the program.

Additionally, you can access a comprehensive set of detailed measurements in the `.trace` files available via the Google Drive link below. These files can be opened and analyzed using the Instruments app on macOS.
